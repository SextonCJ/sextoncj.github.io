    <p>I am a Data Science and Analytics specialist with 15 years of experience building teams and getting the most out of data.
    I like to think I have a calm influence and can bridge the gap between business and technology.
    I am currently wrapping up a Masters degree in Data Science at UC. Berkeley.
    For my day job I am working on brining deep learning text analytics to the compliance and legal profession.</p>

    <p>Please feel free to connect or just check out some of the fun projects I have been working on, all my is code available on <a href="https://github.com/SextonCJ">GitHub</a>.</p>
