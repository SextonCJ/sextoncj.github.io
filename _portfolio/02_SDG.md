### Gender Disparity - World Bank Data

by Chris Sexton, James Byrne, and Yeonjoo Jung.

This is a series of <a href="/assets/SDG/SDG.html">Interactive Charts</a> representing global-scale gender disparity measurements using __d3.js__

The site shows selected [World Bank Data Indicators](https://databank.worldbank.org/home.aspx), representing UN member Sustainable Development Goals. These goals offer a shared blueprint adopted by nations to preserve peace and prosperity for people and the planet. We focus on goals related to Gender Disparity, showing World Bank Indicators by Geography and over time.

The site is designed for UN staff, non-government organizations, charities and government bodies interested in countries' responsibilities to citizens; specifically gender disparity

In this project, we use a variety of d3 visualizations to present a coordinated dashboard, where users can uncover interesting and insightful information.

As with any visualization, this dashboard is intended to support specific tasks:

- See historical trends & track improvements by region and country
- See specific target areas, such as education and employment.
- Identify and diagnose problems to create programs for promotion
- Spot trends and correlations:
  - Foreign aid investment and education standards
  - Foreign aid investment and employment
  - Education standards and poverty
