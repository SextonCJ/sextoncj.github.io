<div style="text-align: justify">
I am a Data Science and Analytics specialist with over 15 years of experience building technically driven teams and getting the most out of data. I like to think I have a calm influence and can bridge the gap between business, product and technology. I have a Masters degree in Data Science at UC. Berkeley. For my day job I work on creating deep learning text analytics products in the compliance and legal profession.

When I'm not working with data, I like to ride bikes, hike mountains or go skiing in the Pacific Northwest.
